# Compiling shaders

By default cmake will compile these shaders into the SPIRV format. This is done by the `glangvalidator` tool located in your `VULKAN_SDK` directory.

To compile the shader, please use build-shader.bat (linux coming soon) in base directory of the project. This will compile all the shaders in the project.
